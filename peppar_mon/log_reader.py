"""Two-phase engine-log consumer: replay then follow.

Why "reader" not "tailer": the monitor needs the engine's start time
(for uptime) and any state the engine has accumulated since startup.
That requires reading the log from the beginning before we can do
anything useful.  Once caught up, we continue following the file for
live updates — the same way ``tail -n +1 -f`` would.

The reader runs in its own daemon thread and exposes a thread-safe
``LogState`` snapshot.  Consumers (the Textual app) poll the state on
a timer — no callbacks, no event queue plumbing for the first pass.
When we add real state (SV-state histogram, NL fix counts, etc.) the
same pattern scales: the reader writes into the state dataclass,
readers read it.

Scope today: extract the engine's start time from the first
timestamped line.  Everything else is a hook for the next commit.

        Engine emits one log line per (SV, signal-pair) the first time
        that pair's biases are looked up — and re-emits whenever the
        bias values change.  Two log line formats are recognized:

        Old format (pre-2026-04-25):
            ``Phase bias lookup: G24 f1=...(HIT) f2=...(HIT) avail=...``
        New format (commit 24a30ab and later):

        and MISS by the literal ``val=MISSm``.  Both formats encode the

        Both HITs → constellation of this SV can reach NL.  We latch
        the constellation as NL-capable on the first HIT-HIT and never
        downgrade.  A single confirmed SV proves the bias pair exists
        in the stream for that system — other SVs may fall in and out
        of individual HIT status, but capability is a property of the
        correction stream, not of any one SV.

        The complement is the useful signal: if no SV of constellation
        X ever shows HIT-HIT, X stays out of the set and the widget
