# PePPAR Fix Glossary

Terms used in code, docs, and lab notes.  When a term has multiple
meanings in different contexts, the PePPAR-Fix-specific meaning is
listed first.

## Oscillators and clocks

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **DO** | Disciplined Oscillator.  The crystal whose frequency is steered by the servo.  On TimeHat/MadHat this is the i226 TCXO controlled via `adjfine()`.  On Timebeat OTC this is the on-board OCXO controlled via ClockMatrix FCW.  Use "DO" when the statement applies regardless of the actuator.  Every PHC has a DO at its core, but a DO can exist without any PHC. |
| **PHC** | PTP Hardware Clock.  The Linux kernel's interface to a NIC's hardware clock (`adjfine()` / `clock_settime()` / `EXTTS`).  Separable from the DO — a PHC always has a DO (some crystal is ticking under it), but not every DO has a PHC.  Use "PHC" only when referring to the kernel interface; use "DO" when talking about the underlying oscillator. |
| **RO** | Reference Oscillator.  The oscillator driving a TICC's 10 MHz reference input.  Parallels the DO: the RO sets the timescale the TICC uses to report edge timestamps.  We can't steer the RO, but we expect and assert long-term stability by comparing it against GPS time via the F9T PPS train on chB.  See `docs/future-work.md` "Reference Oscillator (RO) characterization". |
| **rx TCXO** | The TCXO inside the GNSS receiver (F9T).  Drives the receiver's 125 MHz clock and determines where PPS edges fire (quantized to the 8 ns tick grid).  Do NOT use bare "TCXO" — it's ambiguous with the DO's crystal on i226 hosts, which is also a TCXO. |
| **OCXO** | Oven-Controlled Crystal Oscillator.  Higher stability than TCXO.  The DO on Timebeat OTC boards. |
| **adjfine** | PHC frequency adjustment.  Sets the clock rate in parts-per-billion via the `PTP_CLOCK_SETFINE` ioctl. |
| **FCW** | Frequency Control Word.  The digital command that sets the Renesas ClockMatrix DPLL output frequency. |

## GNSS and corrections

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **GNSS** | Global Navigation Satellite System.  Umbrella for GPS, Galileo, BeiDou, GLONASS. |
| **PPP** | Precise Point Positioning.  Single-receiver positioning using satellite orbit and clock corrections from an SSR stream.  Achieves sub-ns clock estimates after convergence. |
| **PPP-AR** | PPP with Ambiguity Resolution.  Fixes carrier-phase integer ambiguities using phase biases from a single analysis center.  3x lower dt_rx noise than float PPP. |
| **SSR** | State Space Representation.  Satellite-specific corrections (orbit, clock, code bias, phase bias) distributed via NTRIP.  Contrasts with OSR (Observation Space) like VRS/RTK. |
| **NTRIP** | Networked Transport of RTCM via Internet Protocol.  The standard for streaming GNSS corrections over the internet. |
| **RTCM** | Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services.  The binary message format for GNSS corrections (1019, 1045, 1060, 1265, etc.). |
| **ISB** | Inter-System Bias.  The constant time offset between two GNSS constellations (e.g., GPS-Galileo). |
| **ephemeris** | Satellite orbit and clock parameters.  "Broadcast" = from the satellite signal.  "Precise" = from SSR corrections. |
| **carrier phase** | The phase of the GNSS L-band carrier signal.  Sub-centimeter precision but ambiguous by an unknown integer number of wavelengths. |
| **integer ambiguity** | The unknown whole-cycle count in a carrier-phase measurement.  Resolving it ("fixing") eliminates a major noise source. |
| **phase bias** | Per-satellite, per-signal correction that makes integer ambiguity resolution possible.  Only available from single analysis center SSR streams (CAS, CNES, WHU). |
| **code bias** | Correction for signal-dependent pseudorange offsets between different GNSS signals. |
| **dt_rx** | Receiver clock offset from GNSS time, estimated by the PPP filter.  In nanoseconds.  Tracks the rx TCXO phase. |
| **NAV2** | Secondary navigation engine on u-blox F9T (and similar).  Runs in parallel with the primary fix, reports via UBX-NAV2-* messages (NAV2-PVT, NAV2-SAT, etc.).  PePPAR Fix uses NAV2 as an independent position cross-check against its own PPP-AR solution: `displacement = |AntPosEst − NAV2|`.  Both come from the same antenna but NAV2 is a single-epoch code-only single-freq solution (~1-2 m accuracy), so agreement within a few metres is expected; a 10 m+ displacement with NL fixed is strong evidence of wrong integers and triggers a filter reset.  `nav2Δ` in logs is this displacement. |
| **MW** | Melbourne-Wubbena combination.  Geometry-free, ionosphere-free linear combination of dual-frequency code and carrier phase that isolates the wide-lane ambiguity N_WL = N1 − N2.  Converges by averaging out code noise (~60 s).  First step in two-step PPP-AR. |
| **WL** | Wide-lane.  The carrier-phase combination with wavelength λ_WL = c/(f1−f2) ≈ 75 cm (L1/L5).  The wide-lane ambiguity N_WL = N1−N2 is integer and easy to fix from the MW combination because λ_WL is large. |
| **NL** | Narrow-lane.  The carrier-phase combination with wavelength λ_NL = c/(f1+f2) ≈ 10.7 cm (L1/L5).  The narrow-lane ambiguity N1 is the precision target for PPP-AR.  Resolved from the float IF ambiguity once N_WL is known. |
| **CNES** | Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (French space agency).  Provides single-AC SSR corrections on `products.igs-ip.net` mount `SSRA00CNE0`.  CNES phase biases match F9T Galileo signals (L1C, L5Q, L7Q) — the only confirmed source for PPP-AR. |
| **CAS** | Chinese Academy of Sciences.  SSR provider on `SSRA00BKG0`.  Phase biases use I-component (data) codes that don't match F9T's Q-component (pilot) observations.  Cannot be used for PPP-AR. |

## PPS and timing

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **PPS** | Pulse Per Second.  A 1 Hz signal edge used as a timing reference.  Two PPS streams in the system: `gnss_pps` (F9T output) and `do_pps` (PHC PEROUT). |
| **gnss_pps** | The F9T's PPS output.  Fires at the nearest 125 MHz tick to the GPS second.  Subject to 8 ns quantization (qerr). |
| **do_pps** | The DO's PPS output (PEROUT on i226, SMA on E810).  What the servo disciplines. |
| **qErr** | Quantization error.  The sub-8 ns offset between the true GPS second and the rx TCXO tick where gnss_pps actually fires.  Reported by TIM-TP.  This is a **physical quantization** — the PPS edge snaps to a discrete 125 MHz tick grid.  Do not use "qErr" for PPP-derived corrections (those correct for rx TCXO drift, not tick quantization). |
| **PPS correction** | Any correction applied to a PPS measurement to improve its accuracy.  Two types: **qErr** (TIM-TP, corrects tick quantization, discrete ±4 ns) and **PPP drift-model correction** (from smoothed dt_rx, corrects rx TCXO drift, continuous ~0.1 ns).  CLI: `--no-qerr` disables qErr; `--pps-corr ppp` selects PPP drift-model instead of TIM-TP qErr. |
| **TIM-TP** | u-blox UBX-TIM-TP message.  Predicts the qErr of the **next** PPS edge.  Arrives ~0.9 s before the PPS it describes. |
| **TAI** | International Atomic Time.  Continuous timescale (no leap seconds).  TAI - UTC = 37 s as of 2026. |
| **sawtooth** | The periodic phase modulation of gnss_pps caused by the rx TCXO beating against GPS time.  Alternates between "smooth ramp" and "jumpy" regimes. |
| **holdover** | Free-running the DO when the GNSS reference is lost.  The DO drifts at its last-known rate. |

## Measurement instruments

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **TICC** | Time Interval Counter/Counter.  TAPR open-hardware instrument.  60 ps single-shot resolution.  Measures two input channels (chA, chB) independently against an internal timebase. |
| **TAPR** | Tucson Amateur Packet Radio.  The organization that designs and sells the TICC. |
| **EXTTS** | External Timestamp.  Linux PTP subsystem feature: timestamps an external GPIO edge against the PHC clock. |
| **PEROUT** | Periodic Output.  Linux PTP subsystem feature: generates a periodic pulse (e.g., 1 PPS) from the PHC clock. |
| **TDC** | Time-to-Digital Converter.  Hardware that converts a time interval to a digital measurement (used in ClockMatrix). |

## Servo and control

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **qVIR** | qErr Variance Improvement Ratio.  `Δvar(uncorrected) / Δvar(corrected)`.  Measures how much qErr correction reduces the variance of a PPS timestamp stream.  >1.5 = good (qErr is helping).  ≈1.0 = qErr is uncorrelated with the measurement (wrong epoch match).  <1.0 = qErr is making things worse (wrong sign or epoch).  Computed separately for EXTTS (qVIR_extts) and TICC (qVIR_ticc).  High qVIR correlates with low TDEV; low qVIR correlates with high TDEV.  Primary use: detect qErr mis-correlation early so we don't waste a run collecting data with terrible TDEV.  qErr has so much variance (±4 ns) that applying it to the wrong PPS edge is immediately visible in the ratio — smoother correction streams would mask the error. |
| **EKF** | Extended Kalman Filter.  Nonlinear state estimator.  Used in the 4-state DOFreqEst for TICC+PPP fusion. |
| **LQR** | Linear-Quadratic Regulator.  Optimal control law that minimizes a cost function.  Used in the Kalman servo for frequency steering. |
| **PI servo** | Proportional-Integral servo.  Simple feedback controller with gain (Kp) and integral (Ki) terms. |
| **LAMBDA** | Least-squares AMBiguity Decorrelation Adjustment (Teunissen 1995).  The standard algorithm for GNSS integer ambiguity resolution.  Decorrelates the float ambiguity covariance via integer Z-transforms (LDL^T decomposition + Gauss reductions), then searches for integer candidates in the compact decorrelated space.  Validates via ratio test and bootstrap success rate.  Handles ZTD-height-ambiguity cross-correlations that per-satellite rounding ignores. |
| **LDL^T** | Matrix decomposition where L is unit lower triangular and D is diagonal, such that Q = L D L^T.  Used by LAMBDA to decompose the ambiguity covariance.  The D values determine the search bounds and the bootstrap success rate per dimension. |
| **bootstrap success rate** | P(correct integers) estimated from the decorrelated covariance: P = ∏(2Φ(1/(2√D[i])) − 1).  Each dimension contributes independently.  Used as a gate before accepting LAMBDA's integer solution — if P < 0.999, the float covariance is too uncertain for reliable fixing.  Prevents premature AR that the ratio test alone cannot catch. |
| **PAR** | Partial Ambiguity Resolution.  When LAMBDA fails on the full set of ambiguities, iteratively drop the worst-determined ambiguity and retry with the smaller subset.  Continues until the subset passes both bootstrap success rate and ratio test, or until fewer than 4 ambiguities remain. |
| **ratio test** | LAMBDA validation: R = Ω(2nd best) / Ω(best).  Accept if R > threshold (typically 2.0).  Measures how much better the best integer solution is than the runner-up.  Necessary but not sufficient — a high ratio with low bootstrap P can still produce wrong integers. |
| **TTFF** | Time To First Fix.  Time from filter start to first accepted NL integer fix.  With LAMBDA + bootstrap gate: ~10-15 min.  With per-satellite rounding: ~37 min. |
| **PFR** | Post-Fix Residual monitor.  Watches per-SV post-fit PR residuals after NL integers are fixed, to catch wrong integer solutions that the LAMBDA ratio and bootstrap success-rate gates missed.  A wrong integer shifts position to stay self-consistent with its own fix, so σ looks fine — but PR residuals grow as geometry changes.  Three escalation levels: L1 surgical (unfix worst SV), L2 partial (soft-unfix all NL, keep WL/MW), L3 full (re-init PPPFilter at current AR position).  Complements the NAV2 10 m sanity check by detecting wrong integers in the 2-10 m range. |
| **LS** | Least Squares.  Used for initial position estimation before the PPP Kalman filter takes over. |
| **IF** | Ionosphere-Free combination.  Dual-frequency linear combination that cancels first-order ionospheric delay. |
| **TDEV** | Time Deviation.  Stability measure in time units (ns).  TDEV at tau=1s is the primary short-term metric. |
| **ADEV** | Allan Deviation.  Stability measure in fractional frequency units.  Related to TDEV by `TDEV(tau) = tau * ADEV(tau) / sqrt(3)`. |
| **pull-in** | Initial convergence phase where the servo acquires lock from a large phase offset. |
| **glide slope** | Smooth frequency ramp applied during bootstrap to converge the DO's phase offset without overshooting. |
| **loop bandwidth** | The frequency at which the servo's gain crosses unity.  Determines the crossover between DO noise (below) and reference noise (above). |
| **noise floor** | The minimum achievable TDEV of an oscillator or measurement system. |
