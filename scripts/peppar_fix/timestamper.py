"""Timestamper abstraction — unified interface for PPS edge measurement.

A timestamper is anything that measures PPS edges: EXTTS channels on
PHCs, or standalone instruments like a TICC.  This module provides an
ABC and two concrete implementations so that bootstrap frequency
measurement, servo setup, and noise characterization can be written
once against the interface.

See docs/state-persistence-design.md § Timestamper for the data model.
