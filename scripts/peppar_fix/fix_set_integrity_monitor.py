"""Fix-set integrity monitor — catches systemic failures the per-SV
monitors can't attribute to one satellite.

Per `docs/sv-lifecycle-and-pfr-split.md`: the design expects
per-SV issues to be handled by the false-fix monitor and the
setting-SV drop monitor.  This fix-set-wide monitor trips only
for the residual case where *many* members misbehave at once
without any single one being the culprit — genuine systemic
failure (bad SSR correction batch, clock-datum change, reference-
frame shift).  Expected trip rate: < 1/day.  If trips happen more
often, something is broken at the correction-source level.

Old behaviour this replaces: `PostFixResidualMonitor`'s L1→L2→L3
ladder.  That design had a level-persistence bug — once cascaded
to L3 it re-fired on every subsequent misfit, losing ~10 min of
convergence per re-fire (see
`project_pfr_event_analysis_20260419.md`: 0/16 L3 events had a
fresh L1 precursor within 10 min).  This monitor is **stateless**
— each eval looks at the current window and decides independently,
no escalation state carried forward.

The monitor is deliberately conservative.  Triggering requires:
  - Elevated RMS sustained over a window (not a single spike)
  - Minimum epoch gap since the last trip (`cooldown_epochs`)
    — so the re-init action has a chance to take effect before
    we re-evaluate
  - No false-fix or setting-SV-drop event in the same window
    (tracked via the tracker's `state_entered_epoch` — if many
    SVs just went to FLOATING, the per-SV monitors are already
    on it)

Trip action: full filter re-init at `known_ecef`.  Same behaviour
as old L3.  Fix-set-wide; caller clears the NL resolver, MW
tracker, and re-seeds PPPFilter.  Expected < 1/day in steady
state.

class FixSetIntegrityMonitor:
    """Fix-set-wide PR-RMS monitor, stateless per-eval.

    Two trip conditions:

      1. **Window-RMS** (historical): mean PR residual across fix-set
         members sustained above ``rms_threshold_m`` for the sampling
         window.  Catches the gross "many members are lying" case.
      2. **Anchor-collapse** (2026-04-21): on a filter that has
         latched ``reached_anchored=True`` (has ever entered the
         ANCHORED state with ≥ 4 geometry-validated anchors), the
         anchor count drops to zero and stays there for
         ``anchor_collapse_epochs``.  Day0421b showed the trap
         this closes — the filter drifts during a hollow-anchor
         window because the per-candidate join test has nothing
         to anchor to.  When all anchors are gone on a filter
         that once had them, don't try to salvage — tear it down
         and rebuild from bootstrap.  See
         ``project_day0421b_anchor_loss_trap_20260421.md`` and
         ``project_landed_20260421_anchor_collapse_fix.md``
         (858f7da, which originally used a local ``_ever_anchored``
         flag migrated into the ``reached_anchored`` latch in
         Commit (a) of the lifecycle rename).

    The event dict returned by ``evaluate()`` carries a ``reason``
    key so callers can log the trigger type.  Edge-triggered: the
    monitor produces one event at the moment the threshold is
    crossed, then stays silent until ``record_trip`` is called.

    Usage:

        monitor = FixSetIntegrityMonitor(tracker, ape_sm, ...)
        monitor.ingest(epoch, resid, labels)
        ev = monitor.evaluate(epoch)
        if ev is not None:
            # caller executes the re-init: unfix all NL, reset MW,
            # reseed filter, emit the [FIX_SET_INTEGRITY] TRIPPED
            # log line, then tell the monitor it has tripped so
            # both latches clear and the cooldown starts.
            monitor.record_trip(epoch)

    ``record_trip`` is the only state the monitor carries forward
    — just the cooldown timestamp plus the latch clear.  No level
    ladder, no "next step" memory.
