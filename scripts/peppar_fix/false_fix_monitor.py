"""False-fix monitor — detects wrong integer NL fixes on short-term members.

Per `docs/sv-lifecycle-and-pfr-split.md` and the data-driven revision
in `project_pfr_event_analysis_20260419.md`: 62% of today's PFR L1
events are wrong-integer fixes — a recently-NL-fixed high-elev SV
starts showing 3–4 m PR residuals within minutes of the fix.  LAMBDA
believed the integer; reality disagrees.  Action: demote the SV back
to FLOATING so it re-accumulates MW/WL evidence.

Called a "false fix": an integer fix that was later shown to be wrong.

This monitor is deliberately **stateless** between evals.  The
previous `PostFixResidualMonitor` had a level-persistence bug: once
it cascaded to L3 it re-fired on every subsequent misfit, burning
~10 min of convergence per re-fire.  The new design evaluates per-SV
conditions each time and decides independently — no ladder, no
persistent escalation level, no memory of past actions except the
residual window itself (which is naturally time-bounded).

Threshold is per-SV and elevation-weighted.  At zenith the bar is
`base_m` (default 2.0 m — tighter than the old monolithic 3.0 m);
at low elev the bar relaxes by 1/sin(elev) to match physics
(troposphere and multipath scale that way).

Scope: watches ANCHORING only.  Long-term members (ANCHORED)
have, by definition, already survived geometry-change validation;
the setting-SV drop monitor is the right gate for them as they
descend into multipath.

    Usage:

        m = FalseFixMonitor(tracker, ...)
        m.ingest(epoch, resid, labels)   # every epoch with filter residuals
        events = m.evaluate(epoch)       # every `eval_every` epochs
        for ev in events:
            # caller unfixes the SV in NL resolver, inflates filter
            # ambiguity, squelches, etc.; tracker has already moved
            # the SV to WAITING with a per-SV cooldown (ev['squelch_epochs']).
            ...

    Stateless between evals — no ladder, no cooldown that outlives
    the residual window.  If a transition fires, the caller handles
    the downstream effects (unfix, inflate, squelch) — this monitor
    only decides WHICH SVs to transition and updates the tracker.

    ### Elevation-stratified squelch

    The cooldown chosen for the WAITING transition depends on the
    elevation at which the false-fix fired:

      * **elev < reliable_elev_deg** (default 45°): false-fix is
        *expected* for an SV in the multipath-prone band.  Short
        cooldown (`low_elev_squelch_epochs`, default 60 ≈ 1 min).
        Doesn't count toward the unexpected-FF counter.

      * **elev ≥ reliable_elev_deg**, count 1, 2, 3+: *unexpected*
        false-fix — the SV should have been able to stabilize.
        Cooldown escalates via `unexpected_squelch_progression`
        (default (120, 300, 86400) epochs).  Third+ is effectively
        rest-of-arc: the 86400 s (24 h) duration outlasts any
        visible arc; the record is normally forgotten by the engine
        on tracking loss before the cooldown would expire.

    Counter resets when the SV's record is forgotten (arc boundary).
