    Carries two monotonic latches, separately answering:

      * ``reached_anchoring`` — "Has this filter ever produced
        integer fixes?"  Latches on first entry to ``ANCHORING``.
        Equivalent to the old ``reached_resolved`` field —
        fallback-count RESOLVED in pre-rename vocabulary, ≥ 4
        NL-fixed members (short or long) in new vocabulary.
      * ``reached_anchored`` — "Has this filter ever been
        geometry-validated?"  Latches on first entry to filter-
        level ``ANCHORED`` (≥ 4 ``SvAmbState.ANCHORED`` SVs
        concurrently, each having survived ≥ 8° Δaz).  The
        hard-won milestone that signals the position solution
        is defensible.

    Both are cleared only by ``clear_latches()`` — called from
    ``FixSetIntegrityMonitor.record_trip()``, the explicit
    "throw everything out and rebuild from scratch" event.
    Ordinary state regressions (ANCHORED → ANCHORING → CONVERGING
    on slip storm) do NOT clear them; losing anchors means we
    need a different defense (position-anchored join test,
    anchor-collapse trigger), not a bootstrap restart.

    The ``reached_anchored`` latch in particular gates the
    anchor-collapse trigger — firing the monitor only on filters
    that have genuinely earned the anchored state.  Gating on
    ``reached_anchoring`` instead would spuriously trip whenever
    the fallback count dropped to zero, which is the day0421f
    pattern that ``858f7da`` corrected.

    Why here (not on SvStateTracker): both latches are host-level
    properties of the position-solution state, not per-SV facts.
    The state machine is the natural home.
