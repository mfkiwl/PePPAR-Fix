"""SecondOpinionPosMonitor — independent-witness check on PPP-AR position.

Per dayplan I-011533-main / 2026-04-28 evening: the existing per-epoch
``_check_nav2`` watchdog in the engine is **horizontal-only by design**
(altitude-based RESETs cascaded on clkPoC3 in earlier work, destroying
convergence).  That deliberate narrowing leaves a gap: an internally-
consistent wrong-integer commitment that absorbs error into altitude
flies under every existing trigger.  Tonight (2026-04-28) the fleet
demonstrated the gap — three hosts at sub-cm σ, ZTD residuals of +2 m,
altitudes off by 3 / 9 / 14 m, none of the FixSetIntegrityAlarm or
horizontal-only NAV2 watchdog triggers caught it.

This monitor watches the **3D** displacement between the engine's
PPP-AR position and NAV2's independent solution.  NAV2 doesn't share
PPP-AR's wrong-integer failure modes, so a sustained 3D nav2Δ above
threshold is a strong signal that the filter has locked into a wrong
basin.

Naming: kept distinct from FixSetIntegrityAlarm (which checks internal
consistency — residual RMS, ZTD bounds, anchor count, peer-cohort).
"Second opinion" captures the independent-witness semantics — not
"absolute" (NAV2 is not absolute truth, just independent).

The reaction is a full re-init at NAV2's LLA — drop NL fixes, reset MW,
reseed lat/lon/alt all together.  This is what the horizontal-only
``_check_nav2`` does too; the only difference is what we're willing to
let trip the gate.  With the GF_STEP / IF_STEP eviction monitors now
catching most spurious wrong-integer commits, the historical concern
(altitude-based reset cascade) is mitigated: the cohort-median demoters
won't allow a fresh basin to lock onto the same wrong altitude.

Quality gate (added per dayplan I-115539-main workstream C1):
NAV2's own hAcc estimate is included as an admissibility check.  When
hAcc is high (NAV2 itself is uncertain — multipath transient, brief
geometry change, sat just acquired), nav2Δ is unreliable as evidence
of a wrong PPP-AR lock.  The gate uses the rolling-mean hAcc over
the same window as the streak so a single quiet epoch doesn't unfairly
trip; symmetrically, a single noisy epoch doesn't unfairly hold off
once NAV2 has settled.  Default 1.5 m hAcc threshold matches the
typical F9T NAV2 hAcc on a clean RF in stable geometry; tighter will
hold off when geometry transitions briefly inflate hAcc, looser
admits noisier opinions as evidence.

    Usage::
