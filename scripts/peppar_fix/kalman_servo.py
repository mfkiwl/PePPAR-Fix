"""Kalman filter + LQR servo for DO frequency steering.

See docs/glossary.md for term definitions (DO, rx TCXO, etc.).

Replaces the PI servo with an optimal controller that uses a 2-state
model of the DO (phase + frequency) and known noise profiles to
compute the minimum-noise, minimum-overshoot frequency correction
at each epoch.

State model (discrete, per-epoch):
    phase[n+1] = phase[n] + (freq[n] + u[n]) * dt
    freq[n+1]  = freq[n] + w_freq[n]

where:
    phase = DO phase error relative to GPS (ns), i.e. gnss_pps - do_pps
    freq  = DO frequency offset (ppb) — the slowly-drifting crystal rate
    u     = adjfine correction we apply (ppb)
    w_freq = frequency random walk (process noise from DO crystal drift)

Measurement model:
    z[n] = phase[n] + v[n]

where:
    z = TICC+qErr measurement (or EXTTS+qErr, or Carrier)
    v = measurement noise

The Kalman filter estimates [phase, freq] optimally.  The LQR gain
computes the adjfine that minimizes a weighted cost of phase error
and correction magnitude (= noise injected into the DO).

Why this beats PI:
    - PI has no plant model — it reacts to error without predicting
      the effect of its own corrections.  The integrator winds up
      during pull-in and overshoots.
    - Kalman predicts: "I just applied -30 ppb, so phase will change
      by -30 ns next epoch."  The next correction accounts for this.
    - LQR gain is critically damped by construction — fastest
      convergence with zero overshoot, given the noise profile.
    - When measurement noise R changes (TICC vs EXTTS), the gain
      adapts automatically.  No manual kp/ki tuning.
