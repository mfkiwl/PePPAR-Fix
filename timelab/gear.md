### Onocoy — **MOTHBALLED 2026-04-08**

Powered down and disconnected from peripherals.  TICC #2 was moved to
host `ocxo` for the i226 bring-up.  F10T and PX1125T are physically
disconnected and stored.  Confirmed never had a peppar-fix checkout.

## GNSS Receivers

### F9T-3RD

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| EVK model | EVK-F9T-20-00 |
| Module | u-blox ZED-F9T-20B |
| Firmware | TIM 2.25 (PROTVER 29.25) |
| Host | TimeHat |
| Port | /dev/gnss-top (udev symlink, matched by USB ID_PATH) |
| Baud | 115200 |
| Signals | GPS, Galileo, BeiDou, QZSS, SBAS |
| Limitation | **No GLONASS** (-20B hardware variant) |
| Antenna | UFO (SparkFun SPK6618H) via GUS #1 |
| PPS | Wired to TimeHAT SDP1 + TICC #3 chB (EVK SMA) |
| Notes | Brand new unit, installed 2026-03-16. Configured with configure_f9t.py (GPS+GAL+BDS, 1 Hz, survey-in 300s/5m). |

### F9T-TOP

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| EVK model | EVK-F9T-10-00 |
| Module | u-blox ZED-F9T |
| Firmware | TIM 2.20 (PROTVER 29.20) |
| Host | PiPuss |
| Port | /dev/gnss-top (udev symlink) |
| Baud | 115200 |
| Signals | GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou, QZSS, SBAS, NavIC |
| Antenna | TBD (returning to PiPuss for testAnt use) |
| PPS | TBD |
| Notes | Returned to PiPuss 2026-03-16; previously on TimeHat |

### F9T-BOT

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| EVK model | EVK-F9T-20-00 |
| Module | u-blox ZED-F9T-20B |
| Firmware | TIM 2.25 (PROTVER 29.25) |
| Host | PiPuss |
| Port | /dev/gnss-bot (udev symlink) |
| Baud | 115200 |
| Signals | GPS, Galileo, BeiDou, QZSS, SBAS |
| Limitation | **No GLONASS** (-20B hardware variant) |
| Antenna | Patch3 via GUS splitter |
| Notes | Physically on bottom of the stacked EVK pair |

**USB serial note:** Both F9T EVKs present the same USB VID:PID and serial
descriptor under `/dev/serial/by-id/`, so udev cannot reliably distinguish them.
When both are on the same host, symlink assignment depends on USB enumeration
order. The udev rules on PiPuss (`/dev/gnss-top`, `/dev/gnss-bot`) assume a
specific enumeration order that may not hold after re-plugging.

### Adafruit Ultimate GPS (bbb)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|

| Host | bbb |
| Port | /dev/gps0 at 9600 baud |
| Signals | GPS L1 only |
| Antenna | Patch1 via SV1AFN L1 splitter |
| PPS | /dev/pps0 |
| Role | Time-of-day for chrony NTP + PTP GM |
| Notes | Low-cost consumer GPS, adequate for PPS-disciplined NTP/PTP but not for carrier-phase work |

### PX1125T (mothballed 2026-04-08, was Onocoy)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Model | SkyTraq PX1125T (timing firmware) |
| Host | Onocoy |
| Port | /dev/ttyUSB1 (CP2102) |
| Antenna | UFO (SPK6618H) via GUS #1 |
| PPS | Connected to TICC #2 (on Onocoy) |
| Role | PPS timing evaluation (px1125t_eval project) |
| Notes | qErr from $PSTI,00 correlates with velocity, not phase — firmware bug. Raw PPS is good: TDEV(1s)=3.42 ns |

### ZED-F10T (mothballed 2026-04-08, was Onocoy)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Model | u-blox ZED-F10T |
| Host | Onocoy |
| Port | /dev/ttyACM0 |
| Antenna | Patch3 via TAPR GUS active splitter |
| Role | Onocoy GNSS mining stream |

## Timing Instruments

### TAPR TICC #1 (PiPuss)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Model | TAPR TICC |
| Resolution | 60 ps |
| Host | PiPuss |
| Port | /dev/ticc (udev symlink) |
| Baud | 115200 |
| Channels | chA = TimeHAT PHC PPS OUT (SDP0), chB = F9T-BOT PPS |
| Reference | 10 MHz from SV1AFN distribution amp (fed by Geppetto GPSDO) |
| Role | SatPulse / PePPAR Fix TDEV measurement |
| Docs | [TAPR TICC](http://www.tapr.org/ticc.html) |

### TAPR TICC #2 (host: ocxo as of 2026-04-08; was Onocoy)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Model | TAPR TICC |
| Resolution | 60 ps |
| Host | ocxo (moved 2026-04-08; was Onocoy) |
| Port | /dev/ticc2 (USB CDC ACM, Arduino serial 44236313835351B02001) |
| Baud | 115200 |
| Channels | chA = i226 PEROUT (SDP0), chB = F9T-TOP PPS — matches TimeHat / MadHat layout |
| Reference | 10 MHz (when fed) |
| Role | i226 add-in card PPS measurement on host ocxo |
| Docs | [TAPR TICC](http://www.tapr.org/ticc.html) |

### TAPR TICC #3 (TimeHat)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Model | TAPR TICC |
| Resolution | 60 ps |
| Host | TimeHat |
| Port | /dev/ticc (udev symlink, matched by Arduino serial number) |
| Baud | 115200 |
| Channels | chA = TimeHAT PHC PPS OUT (SDP0, SMA1 J4, disciplined), chB = F9T-3RD PPS (EVK SMA, raw GPS) |
| Reference | 10 MHz from SV1AFN distribution amp (fed by Geppetto GPSDO) |
| Role | PePPAR Fix M5 TDEV measurement (disciplined PHC vs raw GPS PPS) |
| Docs | [TAPR TICC](http://www.tapr.org/ticc.html) |

**Reference clock note:** When using TICC for cross-channel time transfer
(comparing chA vs chB), the OCXO reference cancels — both channels share the
same timebase, so the measurement reflects only the PPS difference. For
single-channel absolute measurements, the OCXO's noise floor contributes
directly to the result and must be accounted for.

## Reference Oscillators & Distribution

### Geppetto Electronics GPSDO

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Model | Geppetto Electronics GPSDO |
| Oscillator | OCXO |
| Output | 10 MHz |
| Role | Lab reference clock — feeds distribution amplifier |
| Notes | Decent OCXO for a home timelab; adequate for time transfer, noise floor matters for single-channel measurements |

### SV1AFN 10 MHz Distribution Amplifier

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Model | SV1AFN.Com 10 MHz distribution amplifier |
| Input | 10 MHz from Geppetto GPSDO |
| Outputs | Multiple 10 MHz (feeds TICC reference inputs) |
| Role | Fan-out lab reference clock to multiple instruments |
| Docs | [SV1AFN.Com](https://www.sv1afn.com/) |

### Rubidium Oscillators (×2)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Quantity | 2 |
| Status | **Uncommissioned** — not yet set up for lab use |
| Expected ADEV | ~1e-11 at τ=1s (100× better than F9T TCXO) |
| Potential roles | TICC reference clock (replacing OCXO), independent stability reference, holdover backbone |
| Notes | Commissioning would improve single-channel TICC measurements and provide an independent stability reference |

## SDR Equipment

### Ettus Research USRPs

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | Software Defined Radio (multiple units) |
| Status | Available, not currently used for GNSS |
| Potential role | SDR GNSS receiver (e.g. via [GNSS-SDR](https://gnss-sdr.org/)) |
| Notes | Could accept external Rb reference. However, F9T carrier phase (~2mm) already matches SDR capability — the bottleneck is orbit/clock correction quality (~1.3m from SP3+CLK), not receiver noise. SDR adds raw correlation access and custom PLL bandwidth, but marginal benefit for timing. |

## Antennas

### Mount sites

**West roof slope** — vertical axis eyeball-vertical, non-penetrating mounts.
UFO and ptBoat's SPK6618H are both here.

**East roof slope** — 5:12 pitch. Patch1, Patch2, and Patch3 are mounted with
vertical axes tilted by the roof slope (~22.6° from true vertical). Expected
slight disadvantage on SVs near the west horizon due to tilt.

**Indoors (desk)** — Choke ring antenna only. Not representative of outdoor
performance. Requires a stiffer non-penetrating mount for outdoor deployment
due to larger windload from the radome; mount construction starting 2026-03-13.
